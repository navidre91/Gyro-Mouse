## Gyro-Mouse

Feeling lazy? Do you need to site back and move your finger so that the mouse cursor goes on top of Netflix'es Skip button? The solution is a Gyro mouth that is shaped as a ring you can wear comfortably without any unnecessary bells and wistles to bulk it up. There are only with two small touch buttons acting as right and left click. 
This project is a proof of Gyro mouse concept. It uses a trinket micro controller as the brain of the Gyro mouse and a MPU6040 as the Gyro unit. Also a BLUEFRUIT connection module is used to connect to the host which makes it easy to command the curser to move around based on the readings coming from the gyro. You can find the implementation code in this repository.
